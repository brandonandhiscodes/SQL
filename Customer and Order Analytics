-- For this SQL project, I was tasked with analyzing and interpreting customer data for a fictional company
-- This project was done using SQLite Studio RDBMS

-- Question #1 - How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

-- Note: the ficitonal data used had 'messy data' that needed to be filtered for each query
-- Hence, you may notice that I add last 2 WHERE statements to every query for this project

-- Question #2 - How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT count(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

-- Question #3 - Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID

WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

-- Question #4 - Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT product
,price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1
;

-- Question #5 - What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
-- Here was my first experience working with calculating company revenue with products sold, using SUM and multiplication to get my answer
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product
;

-- Question #6 - Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product
,quantity
,SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product
;

-- Question #7 - How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(DISTINCT cust.acctnum) AS repeat_customers,
avg(quantity*price) AS average_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FS
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE FS.quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

-- Additional Question: List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product
, SUM(quantity) AS quantity_sold
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product
;
